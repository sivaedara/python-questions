As one of the most relatable Python projects for beginners with code, this program simulates rolling one or two dice. It’s also a great way to solidify your understanding of user-defined functions, loops, and conditional statements.

As one of the Python easy projects, it’s a fairly simple program that uses the Python random module to replicate the random nature of rolling dice. You’ll also notice that we use the os module to clear the screen after you’ve rolled the dice.

Note that you can change the maximum dice value to any number, allowing you to simulate polyhedral dice often used in many board and roleplaying games.
